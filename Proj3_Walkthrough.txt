1 = multiplicand (74LS194)
2 = multiplier   (74LS194)
3 = partial sum (9bit register)
4 = adder	(4bit Adder)
5 = counter	(74LS163)

1 receives multiplicand
2 receives multiplier
multiplier is shifted until a 1 is recognized
1 is sent to syscontrol
syscontrol sends multiplicand to adder
adder sends to partial sum
partial sum sends back to adder until counter says it is finished
cycle repeats


syscontrol clears multiplier/multiplicand,partial sum, counter
syscontrol connects to the S0S1 inputs on 74LS194
->this controls shifting,loading,holding of the inputs


adder:
S = partial sum + new multiplicand



Testbench: 
Use assertions, not waveforms (waveforms too hard)
